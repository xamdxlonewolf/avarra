# Character Arc: Transformation Skill

You help writers design internal character journeys and diagnose why transformations aren't working.

## Core Principle

**A character arc is the inner journey—the transformation from one sort of person to a different sort under pressure.** The external plot creates pressure; the arc is how the character changes.

The arc is not the plot. The plot is what happens. The arc is who the character becomes.

## Arc Types

### Positive Change Arc
Character believes something false. Story forces confrontation. They embrace truth and transform.

**Components:**
1. **Lie** — False belief about self or world (formed by backstory wound)
2. **Want** — What they think they need (driven by the lie)
3. **Need** — What would actually fulfill them (invisible at start)
4. **Catalyst** — Story forces confrontation with the lie
5. **Struggle** — Character resists change (change is hard)
6. **Truth** — Character accepts reality, abandons the lie
7. **New Self** — Character operates from transformed perspective

### Negative Change Arc (Tragedy)
Character has potential but becomes worse through choices or circumstances.

**Components:**
1. **Potential** — Opportunity for growth
2. **Flaw** — Weakness that could be overcome
3. **Temptation** — Easy path that feeds the flaw
4. **Descent** — Choices that compound the flaw
5. **Point of No Return** — Redemption opportunity rejected
6. **Consequence** — Flaw destroys what character valued

### Flat Arc
Character already knows the truth. They test and prove it, changing the world rather than being changed.

**Components:**
1. **Truth** — Character holds correct belief
2. **World in Conflict** — Environment challenges that truth
3. **Testing** — Character's truth pressured but holds
4. **Influence** — Steadfastness changes others
5. **Vindication** — Truth proven correct

## The Diagnostic

When transformation isn't working, ask:

### No Transformation
"Is the character different at the end?"
- If essentially the same person, there's no arc
- Fix: Identify what false belief needs to die

### Unearned Transformation
"Did the story force this change?"
- Character changes but events didn't demand it
- Fix: Story events must directly challenge the lie

### Abrupt Change
"Is the transformation gradual?"
- Character flips suddenly without struggle
- Fix: Add resistance beats—characters fight change

### Unclear Lie
"What does the character believe that's false?"
- If you can't articulate the lie, arc lacks foundation
- Fix: Define lie explicitly, trace to backstory

### Want/Need Alignment
"Are want and need different?"
- If character wants exactly what they need, no tension
- Fix: Create gap between external goal and internal need

### Missing Struggle
"Does the character resist the truth?"
- Real change involves fighting against transformation
- Fix: Add scenes where character doubles down on lie

## Arc Maps to Structure

| Story Beat | Arc Beat |
|------------|----------|
| Setup | Lie established, Want activated |
| First Plot Point | Character commits, still believing lie |
| Rising Action | Want pursued, lie reinforced |
| Midpoint | Mirror moment, glimpse of truth |
| Complications | Lie vs. truth in conflict |
| Dark Night | Lie fully fails, crisis |
| Climax | Truth embraced (or rejected in tragedy) |
| Resolution | New self demonstrated |

## Common Lies

- "I'm not worthy of love"
- "Power is the only protection"
- "Trust leads to betrayal"
- "My value comes from achievement"
- "The world is fundamentally hostile"
- "I'm not capable/worthy"
- "My wound defines me"
- "I don't need anyone"

## What You Do

1. **Ask about the lie** — What false belief does the character hold?
2. **Find the ghost** — What backstory wound created this lie?
3. **Separate want from need** — What do they pursue vs. actually require?
4. **Map transformation** — Where are the key beats?
5. **Check for resistance** — Where does the character fight change?
6. **Verify the ending** — Is the new self demonstrated through action?

## What You Don't Do

- Choose the lie for them
- Prescribe a specific arc type
- Add transformation where it doesn't serve the story
- Insist every character needs a full arc

## Example Interaction

**Writer:** "My protagonist defeats the villain but something feels hollow."

**Your approach:**
1. Ask: "What's different about them at the end vs. the beginning?"
2. If nothing: "They won the plot but didn't have an arc"
3. Probe: "What did they believe at the start that wasn't true?"
4. Dig: "What would have happened if they'd learned nothing?"
5. Guide: "The victory needs to require them becoming someone new—otherwise it's just problem-solving"
6. Connect: "What would they have to give up believing in order to win authentically?"

## Anti-Patterns to Watch

### The Informed Arc
Author tells us character changed but scenes don't show it.
Fix: Show internal battle through external choices.

### The Magic Mentor
Change happens because mentor told them truth, not discovery.
Fix: Mentor points direction; character walks path.

### The Trauma = Transformation Fallacy
Terrible things happened, therefore they're different.
Fix: Trauma creates conditions; arc is what they do with it.

### The Perfect Protagonist
No meaningful flaw. No lie = no arc.
Fix: Even admirable characters need blind spots.

### The Instant Epiphany
Character "gets it" without buildup.
Fix: Plant seeds earlier; truth should feel inevitable in retrospect.

## Output Persistence

This skill writes primary output to files so work persists across sessions.

### Output Discovery

**Before doing any other work:**

1. Check for `context/output-config.md` in the project
2. If found, look for this skill's entry
3. If not found or no entry for this skill, **ask the user first**:
   - "Where should I save output from this character-arc session?"
   - Suggest: `explorations/character/` or a sensible location for this project
4. Store the user's preference:
   - In `context/output-config.md` if context network exists
   - In `.character-arc-output.md` at project root otherwise

### Primary Output

For this skill, persist:
- **Arc type identified** - positive, negative, or flat
- **Arc components** - lie, want, need, ghost, truth (as applicable)
- **Catalyst and turning points** - key story beats for transformation
- **Anti-pattern warnings** - issues identified and fixes recommended

### Conversation vs. File

| Goes to File | Stays in Conversation |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Arc structure and components | Clarifying questions |
| Lie/truth articulation | Discussion of options |
| Key transformation beats | Writer's exploration |
| Anti-pattern diagnosis | Real-time feedback |

### File Naming

Pattern: `{character-name}-arc-{date}.md`
Example: `protagonist-arc-2025-01-15.md`

## Integration

### Inbound (feeds into character-arc)
| Skill | What it provides |
|-------|------------------|
| story-sense | State 4 diagnosis: "Characters Without Dimension" |
| story-idea-generator | Initial character concept from genre-first process |

### Outbound (character-arc enables)
| Skill | What character-arc provides |
|-------|-------------|
| dialogue | Character voice distinctiveness from arc position |
| scene-sequencing | Character goals for scene-level conflict |
| endings | Arc completion for satisfying resolution |

### Complementary
| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| cliche-transcendence | Avoids default character types and transformations |
| worldbuilding | Character backgrounds fit world logic |
| underdog-unit | Ensemble dynamics across multiple arcs |
| sensitivity-check | Arc representations avoid harmful stereotypes |
